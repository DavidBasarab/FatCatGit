# FatCatGit

Cats like to live a simple life.  A fat cat wants an even simpler one.  In order to accomplish this FatCatGit goal is to create a simple Git user interface for Windows that is simple to use.  This will be simple for me at my job.  I will not guarantee this will work for any fat cat.  This is inspired by [GitExtensions](http://groups.google.com/group/gitextensions).
